I was stuck in that same trap. Chasing the next deal like my life depended on it. Living commission to commission. No vision past Friday.

Then I learned the real game: You build wealth by thinking 90 days out, not 9 hours.

Here's what changed everything:

1. Started targeting 3-4 deals per MONTH, not per quarter
2. Built systems that work while I sleep
3. Focused on boring markets everyone ignores
4. Stopped trading time for money

Even if you don't really know what you're doing.

Unlike Airbnb, business buying or marketing...

Wholesaling is actually profitable.

Here's why:

Interest rates crushed flippers. They can't get loans.
Inflation killed Airbnb hosts. Bookings are down 40%.
But wholesalers? We're eating.

No money tied up.
No renovations.
No tenants.

Just contracts and cash.

I watched 3 rookies close deals last month. Combined profit: $47,000.

One was a bartender.
One was unemployed.
One just turned 22.

They all followed the same boring process:

1. Find distressed properties on Xome
2. Call sellers using TruePeopleSearch
3. Get property under contract for 70% of value
4. Assign contract to cash buyer for 80% of value
5. Keep the 10% spread

That's a $15K payday on a $150K house.

While everyone else is crying about the economy, we're finding motivated sellers everywhere.

Divorces. Deaths. Job losses.

Sounds harsh but someone's gotta solve their problem.

The best part? You need exactly $0 to start.

No license required.
No credit check.
No experience necessary.

Just hustle and a willingness to hear ""no"" 50 times before your first yes.

TODAY.

Your boss isn’t giving you a raise tomorrow.
Your rent isn’t negotiating with you.
And your 40-hour week? Actually a 168-hour leash.

I broke that leash with one assignment contract and a $14,900 wire.

Now my Tuesday golf habit costs more than my old monthly paycheck.. and the deals keep stacking like clockwork.

What wholesaling ISN'T
🚫 Swinging hammers or HGTV rehabs
🚫 Needing a 750 credit score or huge loan
🚫 Waiting 6 months for a flip to close

What wholesaling IS
✅ Solving a seller’s time problem
✅ Paperwork that locks in equity
✅ Passing that contract to an investor who loves doing the heavy lift
✅ Pocketing the spread. $5K, $15K, $30K+, all before the paint dries

3-Step Playbook

1, Pull the tired-landlord & pre-foreclosure list (DM me “LIVE” for an invite to my free class that shows you how to get these).

2. Use my Worlds Greatest Script to book the appointment.

3. Assign the deal, get paid. 

That’s it. Rinse. Repeat. Scale.

Excuses I hear daily?

“I don’t know real estate.” — Neither did I.

“I don’t have money.” — Good, you don’t need any.

“It’s too late.” — Inventory distress is at a 5-year high; buyers are starving for deals.

That means the road is WIDE open, but only for the ones who move right now.

I used to think you needed huge capital, licenses or a big network to make it work. Nope.

Person #1 – Maria, stuck with a vacant rental draining her savings

Person #2 – DeShawn, flipper with crews twiddling thumbs

Paper #1 – Purchase agreement locking Maria in at $114,000

Paper #2 – Assignment contract passing it to DeShawn for $131,000

Fourteen pen strokes later: $17,000 wired to me. 

No loan, no rehab, no risk.

Why this hits different:
• Works in hot, cold, or sideways markets
• No credit pulls.. just problem-solving cred
• Zero hammer swings = zero midnight “lumber price” panic

How to run the play:
1. Pull leads from free lists online (I'll show you how)

2. Ring till one owner says, “Can you just take it off my hands?”

3. Lock the price, have them sign the assignment contract, and then blast to cash buyers you find in Facebook Groups

Assign ➜ collect ➜ reload.

Usual objections
“Isn’t it complicated?” — If you can tap DocuSign, you can do this.

“Don’t you need money?” — Not a dollar of mine touched that house.

“Isn’t it crowded?” — Distress inventory’s peaking; buyers are starving.

now picture me at 25. broke. no credit. no rich uncle. but i had this crazy idea. what if i could get into real estate without using any of my own money. what if i could get paid to learn the business. sounds too good to be true right.

turns out theres this thing called wholesaling. you find deals. you connect sellers with buyers. you get paid in the middle. no loans. no credit checks. no waiting.

my first deal was a disaster. spent three months chasing a seller who ghosted me. second deal fell through at closing. third time though. i made 8k in two weeks. just from a few phone calls and a contract.

seven years later ive done over 400 deals. some small. some huge. but every single one taught me something. every seller showed me their pain points. every buyer showed me what they really want. every neighborhood showed me where the opportunities hide.

and heres the thing nobody tells you. wholesaling isnt just about quick cash. its about building a network. learning the market. understanding renovation costs. seeing what makes a good rental before you ever buy one.

think about it. when you finally buy that first rental youll already know which contractors are reliable. which areas have the best tenant demand. what repairs actually matter. youll have cash in the bank from your wholesale deals. youll have lenders calling you because they know youre serious.

i watch people go straight into rentals and struggle. they bought in the wrong area. paid too much. hired the wrong contractor. meanwhile the wholesalers who transition to rentals. they crush it. they know the game inside out.

im not saying its easy. nothing worth doing ever is. but its simple. find motivated sellers. match them with cash buyers. collect your fee. repeat. no debt. no waiting years. just action and results.

and honestly the best part isnt even the money. its the confidence. knowing you can create opportunity from nothing. knowing you dont need perfect credit or rich parents. just hustle and the willingness to pick up the phone.

so yeah you could go the traditional route. save for years. beg banks for loans. stress about every repair. or you could start wholesaling next week. make your first deal in 30 days. build your rental empire with house money.

the choice is yours but let me tell you. seven years and 400 deals later. i know which path id choose again...","you're 25 and thinking about buying rentals?

turns out there's this thing called wholesaling. you find deals. connect sellers with buyers. get paid in the middle. no loans. no credit. no waiting.

my first deal was a disaster. three months chasing a seller who ghosted me. second fell through at closing. third? made 30k in two weeks. just a few calls and a contract.

fast forward: 400+ deals later. some small. some huge. every one taught me something.

here’s what nobody tells you:

wholesaling isn't just about quick cash.

it's about building a network, learning the market, understanding reno costs—seeing what makes a good rental before you ever buy one.

think about it: when you buy that first rental, you’ll already know which contractors are solid. which areas have tenant demand. what repairs matter. you'll have cash from wholesaling. lenders will call YOU.

i watch people go straight into rentals and struggle. wrong area. paid too much. hired the wrong guy.

wholesalers who switch to rentals? they crush it. they know the game.

i'm not saying it’s easy. nothing worth doing is.

but it’s simple.

find motivated sellers. match with cash buyers. collect your fee. repeat. no debt. no waiting years. just action.

and honestly, the best part isn't the money. it's the confidence.

knowing you can create opportunity from nothing. you don’t need perfect credit or rich parents. just hustle and a phone.

so yeah, you could save for years. beg banks. stress every repair 👀

or you could start wholesaling next week. make your first deal in 30 days. build your rental empire with house money.

choice is yours. but 7 years and 400 deals later?

i know which path i’d choose again..",the best part isnt even the money. its the confidence. knowing you can create opportunity from nothing.,sellers,,,,,

I walk up to the front door and knock

takes forever but finally this old guy opens up

sweetest smile you ever seen

like the world hasn't touched him at all

we get to talking and he invites me in

tells me about his late wife

how she used to keep everything perfect

I'm six feet tall

he had no idea

literally had not been in his backyard in years

just stopped going out there when she died

too many memories in that garden she loved

forty five minutes we talk

about everything and nothing

his kids who live across the country

the neighborhood when it was new

how he met his wife at a dance in 1962

right there in his kitchen with the peeling linoleum

his eyes light up like Christmas morning

not because of the money

really saw him

tells me this is exactly what he needed

a fresh start

somewhere smaller

closer to his daughter

no more trying to maintain what he couldn't

its a reminder that every house has a story

no lawyers yet

no contracts

just two people who found what they needed in that moment

arms crossed

that look on her face

for 25m it was just two people having a real convo

signed the contract the next day.

no games. no drama. no back and forth.

closed in 22 days.

walked away with $43,450 net profit.

i know what you’re thinking..

""wtf you make it sound so easy"" right?

but here’s the thing:

this isn’t luck. this isn’t magic. It's a system!

a way of seeing opportunity that most people scroll right past.

take a second and think..

how many listings do you ignore every day?
how many deals do you assume someone else already grabbed?
or think you need cash?
experience?
connections?

wrong.

what you need is to understand how this really works.

how to find deals. talk to sellers. structure offers.

because once you see it, you can’t unsee it.

like putting on glasses for the first time: suddenly, everything’s clear.

you start spotting deals everywhere.

at gas stations. on lunch breaks. at home depot. on facebook. through friends and family. just scrolling your phone.

25-minute phone calls turn into 5-figure paydays.

but only if you know what to say.

only if you understand what sellers really want.

only if you can spot the difference between a dead end and a goldmine.

this deal?

it was sitting there for anyone. literally anyone could have called.
but they didn’t.

you know why?

because they don’t know what i know.

they haven’t trained their brain to see it.

they haven’t learned the language of opportunity.

$43k from one phone call.

one conversation.

one person willing to actually talk to another human being.

no fancy tricks. no complicated strategies. just seeing value where others see problems.

solving those problems and having the guts to make the call.

this changes how you see money forever.

you stop thinking in hourly wages.

you start thinking in value creation.

you stop waiting for permission.

back in 2016 i was broke. like really broke. the kind where you check your bank balance and immediately regret it. i remember counting coins for gas money. sleeping on couches. eating ramen for the third day straight.

2018 hit different though. zero dollars. zero hope. everyone around me had real jobs with benefits and retirement plans. meanwhile i was chasing some crazy dream that nobody understood. my parents stopped asking how i was doing. friends started avoiding my calls. probably thought id ask for money again.

2019 was the year i almost quit. almost. people gave up on me left and right. told me to be realistic. get a normal job. stop dreaming so big. there were nights i laid awake wondering if they were right. maybe i was just fooling myself.

but something inside me refused to die. this tiny voice that whispered keep going. just one more day. one more try. one more chance.

2020 came and while the world was falling apart i was quietly building. learning. growing. failing forward. nobody saw the late nights. the rejections. the moments i cried in my car. but i kept showing up.

then 2023 happened. my real estate business hit 7 figures. bought two more companies. suddenly the same people who doubted me were asking for advice. funny how success changes things.

2025 brought the best plot twist. married my best friend. someone who saw me at my lowest and still believed. we travel now. not because we have to wait until were 65. but because we decided freedom doesnt have a retirement age.

im writing this from a beach i used to stare at on my phone screen. surrounded by strangers who became friends. creating memories i used to only dream about.

your future self is waiting for you to make that first move. stop telling yourself youll do it someday. stop waiting for permission. stop thinking you need to have it all figured out.

i started with nothing but refused to end with regrets. and if i could tell that broke girl from 2016 one thing it would be this...

youre going to make it. but only if you start today.",freedom shouldn't wait. you shouldn't either.,freedom shouldn't wait. you shouldn't either.,n/a,,,,,

Somewhere out there. And they’ve just been told... they’ve got 24 hours left.

""nice! thanks for the existential crisis, Ben!""

but really stop and think about it. that person would give ~anything~ for your Tuesday.

Your regular, boring Tuesday. 

The one where you hit snooze three times, flipped someone off in traffic, and had breakfast for dinner because you could.

They’d take that day and they’d be thrilled.

I haven’t stopped thinking about that since I first heard it.

Yesterday, I was just stuck. locked on the couch.

In any otherwise hectic day I was laying there and couldn’t decide.. gym? clean? review more deals? 

I ended up doing none of it. wasted the rest of the day because I was tired. then I remembered... somewhere, someone is running out of hours

The person with 24 hours left wouldn’t have cared that it wasn’t perfect. they’d be pumped to have anything. even a lazy half Tuesday like mine.

Now every time I get stuck I think about this, awful as it may sound.

and it doesn’t magically fix everything, but it gets me to move.

Do it sad. Do it tired. Do it with mismatched socks and a bad attitude. Do it anyway. 

because somewhere, someone can’t. 

and you can.

and honestly.. that’s the only reason you need.",,,,,,,

if you ask god to win a marathon he'll send you a pair of shoes not a medal.

i think about that a lot. like really think about it.

because we're always asking for the finish line aren't we? the promotion. the perfect relationship. the dream house. the success story.

but what if the answer to our prayers isn't the thing itself. what if it's the tools to get there.

sarah wanted her presentation to blow everyone away. but instead of a magical perfect performance she got something else. her laptop crashed the night before. forced her to rebuild everything from scratch. made her know that content inside and out.

she didn't get the medal. she got the shoes.

and honestly that's harder to accept sometimes. because shoes mean you still have to run. shoes mean blisters and sweat and maybe not finishing first. shoes mean the work is yours to do.

but here's what i've learned. when you get the shoes instead of the medal you become someone different. someone who knows they can run 26.2 miles. someone who earned every single step.

my grandma ran exactly one marathon in her life. she was 67. crossed that finish line dead last with a huge smile on her face. they were packing up the cones when she came through.

but she wore those beat up running shoes to church every sunday after that. like they were made of gold.

because sometimes the gift isn't the destination. it's becoming the person who can get there.

sarah killed that presentation by the way. not because she was given confidence. but because she built it. step by step. slide by slide.

and now i'm looking at my own prayers differently. maybe i've been asking for medals this whole time. maybe what i really need is just the right pair of shoes.

the thing is once you have the shoes you realize something else...",,,,,,,,

met this guy at a coffee shop yesterday. shaking hands, sweating through his shirt. about to pitch his business idea to an investor. told me he'd been rejected 47 times already.

""why keep going?"" i asked.

he pulled out this worn notebook. pages and pages of nos. but after each rejection, he'd written what he learned. what he'd do different next time.

that's when it hit me.

the winners i know? they all started like this. terrified. doubting every move. but they had one thing the quitters didn't.

they showed up anyway.

my first business? failed spectacularly. lost everything. sat in my car crying, wondering if i was fooling myself. but i went to work the next day. and the next.

fear never left. it just got quieter.

see, self-doubt is like a shadow. the more light you shine, the smaller it gets. and work? work is the light.

that guy in the coffee shop? he's gonna make it. not because he's confident. but because he's still showing up after 47 nos.

and that notebook of his? that's not a record of failure...","I've never met a man who outworked his self-doubt and didn't eventually win.

winners dont start with confidence. they start with fear.

fear that they're not good enough. fear that everyone will see right through them. fear that theyll fail and prove all the doubters right.

but here's what separates them from everyone else stuck in their head:

they show up anyway.

i've never met a man who didn't start messy who didn't wait for perfect and didn't eventually win.

you know why most people never make it? theyre waiting. 

waiting for the perfect moment, a complete plan or just the right feeling.

meanwhile the guy already winning is the one who's already started.

yeah his first attempt looks like garbage... but hes moving.

the man that shows up everyday. thats the man who wins.

when its raining. when he's tired. when nobody believes in him. when he doesn't even believe in himself.

you can spot him in any room. he's not the one dominating conversations. he's not the one posting every small win. he's not the one telling everyone about his big plans.

because commitment doesn't need an audience or validation.

tomorrow when your alarm goes off and your mind starts listing all the reasons why today isn't the day, why youre not ready or why you should wait.

remember this:

somewhere right now theres a man with more doubt than you. less talent than you. worse circumstances than you.

...and hes already started.

rose,published,"July 31, 2025 at 6:48 PM",1QUV15JyUS3H1Jqim7TvZ35FZOidU2ktJ,,how much should I offer on a property?,"I started with nothing but this one formula that changed everything.

So you want to know exactly what to offer on a property? Cool. I get this question literally every single day.

Here's what most people don't realize. There's actually a stupidly simple formula that takes all the guesswork out of it.

First thing - you gotta know your ARV. That's After Repair Value for anyone new here. Basically what the house will be worth when it's all fixed up and pretty.

Then here's where it gets good. Take that ARV and multiply it by 0.7. That gives you your baseline.

Now subtract your repair costs. Be real about this number. Not what your cousin's friend who ""does construction"" tells you. Get actual contractor bids.

So let's say the ARV is 200k. Times 0.7 equals 140k. Your repairs are 30k. Your max offer? 110k.

But wait. There's more to this.

See, that 70% rule isn't just some random number I pulled out of thin air. It accounts for your profit, holding costs, realtor fees, and all that fun stuff that eats into your margins.

Now here's where beginners mess up. They get emotional. They start thinking ""but what if someone else offers more?"" or ""this is such a good neighborhood though.""

Stop. The numbers either work or they don't.

I've done over 100 deals with this exact formula. Sometimes I lose out to higher bidders. And you know what? Good for them. They probably lost money.

The real secret isn't just knowing the formula though. It's sticking to it when everyone else is going crazy. That's when the real money gets made.

Want to know the one adjustment I make that's helped me close 30% more deals without losing profit? Because once you understand this next part...","I used to freeze up every single time i had to make an offer on a property

I'd spend hours staring at comps trying to figure out the perfect number

analyzing every detail until my brain felt like mush

then id either lowball and lose the deal or overpay and kick myself later

until my mentor showed me something that changed everything

we were sitting in this dingy coffee shop going over a potential flip

I was doing my usual overthinking routine when he grabbed a napkin

drew three simple boxes

first box he wrote ARV
second box he wrote repairs
third box he wrote profit

then he did something so simple i felt stupid for not seeing it before

he drew arrows connecting them

ARV (-) Repairs (-) Profit (=) Your Offer

no complex spreadsheets, just basic math that works

I remember thinking it cant be that simple

but then we ran the numbers on that flip and after it was all said and done

that deal made me exactly 42k profit

now i use this formula on every single deal

sometimes i adjust the profit based on the risk but the formula never changes

harder renovation means i need more profit, easy cosmetic stuff maybe i take less

but here's the thing that really matters

when you know your numbers you can move FAST

the best part is you can explain it to sellers too

show them exactly why your offer makes sense

they might not like it but they understand it

and understanding builds trust, even when they say no initially

which happens a lot

but when their other buyers fall through.. guess who they remember?

I remember calling every number I could find online. leaving voicemails that never got returned. posting in facebook groups hoping someone would bite. nothing. meanwhile the clock was ticking on my contract.

that night I made a decision. if I was gonna make it in this business I needed a real buyers list. not just 10 or 20 names. I needed hundreds. thousands even.

started simple. went to every reia meeting in a 50 mile radius. brought donuts. people love donuts. collected business cards like they were gold. because they were.

then I discovered something. cash buyers leave breadcrumbs everywhere. property records showed who bought with cash. landlord associations had member lists. hard money lenders knew everyone.

within 90 days I had 500 names. kept pushing. automated my outreach. built relationships instead of just collecting contacts. year later I crossed 7,000 verified cash buyers.

now when I get a deal, I send one text blast. phone blows up within minutes. multiple offers. bidding wars. exactly how wholesaling should work.

the difference between struggling and succeeding in this business? its not about finding better deals. its about knowing exactly who wants them before you even make an offer. if you're still wondering who's gonna buy your next deal...","this question kills more wholesalers than anything else I see..

“but what if i don’t have a buyer?”

and hey, i get it!

why bother chasing a deal if you don’t have someone to hand it off to?

that pit in your stomach when the clock is ticking and there’s no solid buyer lined up? that's real.

but stop letting that be the reason you’re not calling homeowners.

stop using it as an excuse to avoid taking action.

after 400+ deals, i can tell you this with full confidence—

i’ve never had a deal i couldn’t find a buyer for.

never.

the truth is, if the deal is good, the buyers will show up.

yes, it’s smart to build your buyers list over time.

yes, it helps to have a few hungry investors ready to go.

absolutely, send out texts, go to meetups, post on socials, do all of it.

but that’s not the starting point.

your first move isn’t to build a perfect buyers list.

your first move is to get a property under contract.

because buyers don’t want “leads” or “maybes.”

they want deals. they want numbers. they want contracts.

so flip the mindset.

you don’t need 50 buyers to get started.

you need one deal to attract the right buyers.

don’t sit on your hands worrying about step 5 when you haven’t done step 1.

if you’ve got a solid deal and you know how to present it, you can find buyers in Facebook groups, in your network, through other wholesalers..

even right here in your city who are looking for their next project.

the key is action.

make the calls. talk to sellers. get the reps in.

Back then, it was simple. and it worked. Today.. its a fucking mess. Let me tell you what changed. 2008 through 2015 was like the wild west of real estate. You could buy a decent rental for 50k, put 10k down, and rent it for $800. Do that 10 times and boom. Financial freedom. But somewhere along the way everything shifted. Property prices doubled. Then tripled. Interest rates went from 3% to 7%. Insurance companies lost their minds. And dont even get me started on property taxes. What used to cash flow $500 per door now barely breaks even. If youre lucky. The old playbook is dead. The one where you just buy and hold and wait. Where you could half ass property management and still make money. Where appreciation was guaranteed. That shit doesnt work anymore. But heres what nobody wants to admit. The opportunity is still there. Its just different. Way different. And most people are too stuck in 2010 to see it.

That’s not investing. That’s praying in property form.

Most new investors don’t realize the math changed.

• $250K home
• $1,600 mortgage
• $1,800 rent (maybe)

By the time you pay taxes, insurance, maintenance?
You’re netting enough for Taco Bell.

You need volume to make rentals work.. and volume costs cash.

That’s why I tell every beginner the same thing: Start with wholesaling.

It’s fast. It’s low risk. It pays you to learn the game.

And one $20K deal moves you further than a year of rental income.

Use wholesaling to build the capital.

Then go back and buy properties the right way.

No fluff. No theory. Real results.

First thing I'd do?

Forget the sexy markets. No Miami. No Vegas. No LA.

I'd go straight to the boring zip codes where everyone else is sleeping.

That's where the money lives.

Step 1: Find distressed properties nobody wants
Hop on Xome or Auction.com. Filter for properties under $150K that need work.
These sellers are DESPERATE.

Step 2: Get them under contract for 50-70% of value
No cash needed. Just a simple one-page agreement.
(DM me ""CONTRACT"" and I'll send you mine free)

Step 3: Find a cash buyer
Post in local Facebook real estate groups. Text every ""We Buy Houses"" sign.
Investors are foaming at the mouth for deals right now.

Step 4: Assign the contract
Sell your position for $10-20K profit.
Never touched the property. Never spent a dime.

That's wholesaling.
That's how you print money with $0.

While everyone's crying about interest rates...
